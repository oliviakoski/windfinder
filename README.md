Wind Finder uses Amazon Web Services cluster computing resources to quickly identify
areas of steady, constant winds using data available from the 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory's WIND Toolkit dataset. These target areas
may then be further studied by renewable energy entrpreneurs to determine
suitability for building wind turbines.
